# Representing the UNNC as a Exchange Student Spokesman

The UNNC Global Engagement Office released a program that brings the opportunity for students that are open-minded, enthusiastic in Chinese culture and the UNNC, and with a passion in communication, to promote their experiences with other people as a spokesman of the UNNC.

To apply, us, candidates, had to showcase our strengths for this position. I appealed to my comfort in public speaking and in front of a camera, like when I recorded my winter vacations, hosted a singing competition at the UNNC (Wonderful Us 2023), assisted interviews as a UNNC Global Ambassador by the UNNC to share my experience in China, or took part in several UNNC Marketing photo shoots and video shoots. I also shared with them times when I discussed my views on Chinese culture on written communications such as articles and posts in several platforms like Instagram, WeChat, or LinkedIn.

After each candidate showed their aptitude for the program, I passed as one of the 6 exchange student spokespeople for the UNNC! Let's now see what was one of my most memorable responsabilities under this position.

## UNNC Partner Day

During the UNNC Partner Day I fulfilled my most important responsability as a UNNC Spokesman: sharing with partner institutions and other UNNC departments about my experience at the UNNC and in China. This day has the goal of strenghtening bonds and forging new connections between institutions, therefore it was an honour for me to contribute to the cause by talking about my experience to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, University of Southern California, University of Glasgow, Boston University, Xiamen University, City University of Hong Kong Dongguan, Loughborough University, Bocconi University... (these are some I can remember, but the room was filled with representatives!). As such, I prepared a (really cool) presentation in which I went through different key points of my time here in China, from the UNNC Welcoming Week, to cultural activities, opportunities on campus, my associations and clubs, sports, and friendships.

_Talking about the Welcoming Week at the UNNC_

I like to keep my material for the presentations, like the PowerPoint, really light word-wise and, if possible, to keep only pictures and some keywords around. Besides, I also included a small clip from my video of the winter vacations in China, so the talk turned even more enjoyable.

Overall,
