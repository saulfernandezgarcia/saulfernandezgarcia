# HELLO!
I am Saúl Fernández García, PhoenixAblaze, and you are in the README.md file of my personal github site because you maybe fiddled around and stumbled upon the project itself, rather than the deployed website. Please click here: [my website](https://saulfernandezgarcia.github.io/) to visit it.

Nonetheless, I would like to here say thank you, a really, really, intense thank you to the team that created the Chirpy Theme for Jekyll sites. This format was exactly what I was looking for: organised and clean. Please check the link to the full project here: https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter .
